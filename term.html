        <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
        
        <p>We’ve tried to keep our Terms and Conditions as clear as possible, and give you all the information we can (but not too much) about your online transactions so that you completely understand the whole process, from order to delivery and beyond. It’s really important to us that your online shopping experience meets expectations, so please spend a few minutes and read on.</p>

        <p>You’ll need to accept our T’s & C’s every time you make a purchase – they might change from time to time, so do check the date at the top of the page. Please note that different terms (including prices, charges for services, availability, delivery times and returns policies) apply to purchases made in one of our stores.</p>

        <p><strong>Our contract after you have ordered</strong></p>

        <p>Firstly, don’t panic if you make any mistakes during your order, you can correct any input errors right up until you confirm payment. Once you’re happy everything is correct and you’ve submitted an order you’ll be given an Order Reference Number and details of the products (and/or services) you have ordered. You’ll then receive an email headed ‘Order Acknowledgement’ recognising receipt of your order. We will then send a further email headed ‘Order Confirmation’. This second email also lets you know how your products will be delivered to you. If we have to cancel all or part of your order for any reason, we will email you to let you know. Sometimes we have to hold our hands up and admit we have made a mistake by unintentionally publishing inaccurate information on the site (e.g. the price, description or availability of a product you have ordered). In this instance we may have to cancel your order at any time, even if you have received your Order Confirmation email, and you will receive a full refund of any charges already paid. If you choose our Reserve and Collect service you will be given a reference number and details of your order.</p>

        <p><strong> Prices and payments</strong></p>
        <p>As you would expect all our prices are in UK pounds. The total cost of your order will be the price of the products you order, the delivery charge (if any), plus any additional services you choose e.g. premium delivery or installation. You’ll see all these in your Shopping Basket before you submit an order. Payment is deducted once an order is submitted. When deciding whether to accept your order we may use certain information about you, including any received from our accredited identity verification partner. For example, we may pass on your details for them to check against certain public and private databases. This will help to protect you and us from fraudulent activities. If we identify a transaction as being potentially fraudulent we may ask our courier to return the goods to our warehouse, we may cancel your order even though you will have received the Order Confirmation email.</p>

        <p><strong>Missing, damaged or incorrect orders</strong></p>
        <p>We do everything we can to ensure your order arrives at your door complete and in pristine condition. If you don’t receive all of your products at once, you can check that they have been dispatched using our tracking facility detailed in the confirmation email. If it’s not on its way, you can contact us via the Customer Services page or telephone 0114 268 7999. In the unlikely event that the product is faulty, please follow the instructions in the delivery documents.</p>

        <p><strong>Returns/cancellations and after sales policy</strong></p>
        <p>If for whatever reason you change your mind and would like to return your order after delivery, we’re happy to refund or exchange your purchase as long as it’s unopened and in its original packaging. This option is available for 21 days after delivery. Following The Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations, we will accept items back even if you have opened the goods to inspect them. You are entitled to a refund as long as you inform us of your decision to cancel within 14 calendar days from the day after delivery of the goods. The goods must be in an ‘as new’ condition and returned in the original, undamaged packaging, along with any accessories and free gifts received with them. You can examine the goods as you would in a shop but you must not have used or installed them or input any data on them. Whilst the goods are in your possession you must take reasonable care of them. Software packaging discs must still be sealed. If you want to return a Software Product Activation Key card which is not faulty, the silver strip on the back of the card must be fully intact as new. In the case of a service contract or a contract for the supply of a digital download, the cancellation period will expire after 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract. If you consent to a digital download starting within the 14 day cancellation period and acknowledge the right to cancel will be lost, you will not be able to request a refund.</p>

        <p><strong>We cannot refund/cancel your purchase:</strong></p>
        <p>If you return your product to a store without proof of purchase.
            If the silver strip on the back of your Software Product Activation Key card has been partially or completely damaged or removed.
            The goods were a special order to your specification</p>

        <p><strong>Faulty goods</strong></p>
        <p>It’s bad enough that your product develops a fault, so we try to make our returns or repair service as painless as possible.</p>
        <p>You always have the option of an exchange or refund if the fault occurs within 21 days of delivery. If the fault with your product occurs within its guarantee period (normally 12 months from delivery) we will offer you a prompt repair service*. In all cases we reserve the right to inspect the product and verify the fault.</p>
        <p>For a refund or exchange, the product must be in otherwise ”as new” condition, complete with any accessories and free gifts offered and if possible, with the original box and packaging.</p>
        <p>THIS RETURNS POLICY DOES NOT AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. DETAILS OF YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS ARE AVAILABLE FROM TRADING STANDARDS OR CITIZENS ADVICE CONSUMER SERVICE.</p>
